            <h1><u>WELCOME TO OUR WEBSITE!!</u></h1>
        <p>
            We are a team of first-year engineering students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence). 
            Driven by our passion for creating meaningful visualizations, we have come together to develop a COVID-19 visual trends dashboard, covering Global and Indian data using Power BI.
            Our journey into the world of data visualization began with our participation in competitions like Viz-a-thon 2.0, where we honed our skills and gained valuable experience. 
            Since then, we have been committed to pushing the boundaries of visualization techniques and leveraging our technical expertise to create impactful solutions.
            In today's world, where information overload is a common challenge, we believe that effective visualizations play a crucial role in distilling complex data into simple and understandable insights. 
            Our dashboard is meticulously crafted to offer users a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the COVID-19 situation. By providing detailed past insights, our platform equips users with valuable information to inform their decisions and strategies for the future.
