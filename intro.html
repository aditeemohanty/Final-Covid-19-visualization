          <br><span class="pointer">&#9658;</span><u>MOTIVATION</u>
          <br>Our motivation for creating this project stems from the critical importance of understanding the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on both a global scale and within India. 
          <br>By meticulously studying various parameters such as vaccination rates, infection and mortality data, testing capabilities, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic factors, we aim to glean invaluable insights that can inform future public health strategies and preparedness efforts. 
          <br>Through our comprehensive analysis, we endeavor to contribute to the collective understanding of the pandemic's dynamics, aiding policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in devising effective measures to mitigate its impact and bolster healthcare systems for future challenges.

        <br><span class="pointer">&#9658;</span><u>OBJECTIVES </u></p>
        <br>The objectives of our project are to comprehensively study the COVID-19 pandemic on a global and Indian scale. 
        <br>We aim to analyze leading vaccination manufacturers globally and vaccination distribution by demographic in India. 
        <br>Additionally, we will assess the vaccination status of citizens, including first, second, and booster doses. 
        <br>We will also examine the number of test samples collected by state and investigate non-virus-related causes of deaths. 
        <br>By examining these parameters, our project seeks to provide valuable insights into the pandemic's impact, aiding in the formulation of targeted interventions, resource allocation, and future pandemic preparedness efforts.
